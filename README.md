### Memories Forever Cherished Photography

I am the type of photographer that loves to *capture that moment*. The moment he takes her in his arm and gives that loving smile, or the moment your child is being the child she is and dancing to her heart's content, or the family moment when everyone is laughing because someone said something silly. Whatever the moment, *that* is what I want to capture. The posed pictures are good, and I will also take those, but the candid moments are when we see true personalities shine through. My specialty is photographing children. I will chase them around a park, run with them, and get down to their level to make them feel like they are just playing rather than taking pictures. I also photograph weddings, families, engagement photos, babies, and pregnancies. Whatever memory you want to be forever cherished, I'm your photographer.
